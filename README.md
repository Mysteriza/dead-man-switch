**Dead Man Switch** is a web application that allows users to set a timer that will automatically send a message, instruction, or something important to tell your family or loved ones via email if the user fails to "check-in" within the specified time (presumed dead or kidnapped by the government or terrorists). This application is useful for ensuring that important information is delivered even if the user is unable to do so manually.

## Key Features

- **Timer with Countdown**: Set a timer with a specific duration or a specific time.
- **Check-In**: Perform a check-in to reset the timer.
- **Automatic Sending**: If the timer runs out, the application will automatically send a message.
- **Email Support**: Send messages via email (using SendGrid).
- **Password Check-In**: Add an extra layer of security with a check-in password and an emergency password.
- **Custom Interval**: Set the check-in interval manually (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months).
- **File Attachment**: Send files as message attachments.'
### As a reference, the default password is the one you use to stop the timer or check-in. Meanwhile, the emergency password is used when you are under pressure. In this case, if you are coerced or forced by kidnappers to stop the timer, you can enter the emergency password to instantly send the information or message without waiting for the timer to expire.
